**A mixin and functions library for Sass**

## Note for Sunglass 2.x users

As of Sunglass 3.x all function and mixin names now have an underscore in front of it. If you would like to upgrade, please check your syntax.
I made this decision to resolve conflicts with other libraries. Feel free to email any death threads to spam@devatrox.de.

## Requirements
Sass 3.3+

## Installation

* Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/)

    `bower install sunglass --save-dev`

* Or Download the [latest release](https://github.com/devatrox/Sunglass/releases) and put it wherever you like

* Import Sunglass into your Sass file

    `@import "path/to/sunglass";`

* Change settings before the `@import` statement (optional)
    ```` sass
    $sunglass: (
      base-gap: 30px,
      base-font-size: 18px
    );
    ````


I will create a detailed documentation later on. Until then, head over to the [makeshift docs](docs.md)
